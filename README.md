## About Me
Hi, I'm **Rohil Rao**, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Bonn with hands-on experience in advanced AI-driven projects, machine learning, and data science, particularly for text and image data. I love implementing projects in Python and PyTorch and have worked on projects such as improving domain shift in brain MRI segmentation, explainable fake news detection, and semi-supervised video frame prediction.

My experience spans various data-related roles in academic and industry settings. At Tata Consultancy Services in India, I worked on a cloud-based project for an SAP-based ERP solution where I focused on data analysis and KPI reporting, identifying operational anomalies, and creating dashboards. My role at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development involved analyzing and consolidating large-scale longitudinal data for the Berlin Ageing Study. As a Research Assistant at Fraunhofer IAIS, I researched methods for identifying systematic weaknesses in AI models, specifically for pedestrian detection.

I am passionate about AI research, and my Google recommendation feed consists mostly of the latest findings in AI for vision, text and multimodal AI models.
